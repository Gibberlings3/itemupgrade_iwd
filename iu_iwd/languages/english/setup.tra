@1000 = ~Yeti Hide Armor +1~
@1001 = ~Hide Armor is made from the thick skin of large animals (yeti, in this case) or layers of thinner, more common leather.  It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids.  It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use.

This particular set of armor was cured by Conlan and enchanted by Orrick. Orrick was not able to quite get rid of its inherited weakness against fire, though it offers some natural protection against cold.

Some thieves, however, revere Gond for his role in the development of locks, traps, and other complex machines.  One such thief was the burglar Jurmar the Calm, who began his career as a locksmith.  Known for his cool demeanor and steady hand, Jurmar paid priests of Gond to fashion this tool belt for him.  Whenever Jurmar was stuck in a situation where he didn't have the right tool for a job, one of the small pouches on the belt would supply him with what he needed.

@1016 = ~Gloom~
@1017 = ~In 834 DR, a wizard named Legedain the Wiser caught a renowned thief breaking into his tower.  The thief was a cynical burglar named Ilfain Blackfeather.  Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body.  To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem.  Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby.  One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it.  He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword.  Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat.  Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks and he threw it into the street.  A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. The constant criticism from the sword also makes it difficult to hit its target. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

Kieran Nye has applied a permanent Hope spell to the sword. While the sword is still very gloomy, it no longer criticizes its wielder and its thieving abilities can be used more often.

The weapon has an unearthly look to it, and it is believed to be quite old.  The only individual known to have carried the weapon was a half-elven bard named Daen Winterbrush.  It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, that he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him.  He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.  It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

By singing the ballad of Daen Winterbrush and speaking with his spirit, more abilities of the blade have been awakened.

@1020 = ~This axe was crafted for a powerful young barbarian warrior named Hegelfden.  He was born into the Tribe of the Elk and the shamans prophesized that he would be a powerful warrior.  Hegelfden grew up believing that he was special, important, and somehow better than those around him.  By the age of seventeen, Hegelfden was an accomplished warrior.  Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen.  On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave.  He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him.  The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle.  When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request.  He wanted to keep them as servants.  The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden.  They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him.  Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life.  The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across.  His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood.  The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp.  When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

With Tiernon's guidance, the angry dwarven souls in the axe have been laid to rest.

Plane-traveling wizards who have investigated life on "Eibrancha" report that it is dull, commonplace, and ordinary in the extreme, a place where heroes are rare and the populace is, by and large, incredibly average.  This might explain the virtually non-existent body of recorded information about the place.  The only thing known about the weapon's owner is that he was an educated man. The purple wood that the crossbow is constructed from is believed to be from a unique type of tree in Eibrancha.
