# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = "One of the many fantastic things about Icewind Dale was the time the writers took in their item descriptions. This mod started by reading various item descriptions and trying to tell more of their story. The scope of the mod is fairly modest, as only 11 items are eligible for upgrade. Six items, based on Baldur's Gate II, are also available."
